## Analyze the flowchart image and convert it to Mermaid syntax.

Follow these requirements strictly:

1. Use proper Mermaid flowchart syntax starting with 'flowchart TD' (top-down) or 'flowchart LR' (left-right)
2. Identify all nodes/boxes and give them appropriate IDs (A, B, C, etc.)
3. Include all decision diamonds with proper syntax using {condition?}
4. Add all connecting arrows and labels using ONLY '-->' (not '-- >' or other variations)
5. Use appropriate node shapes:
   - [Text] for process boxes
   - {Text} for decision diamonds  
   - ((Text)) for start/end circles
   - [Text] for regular rectangles
6. Include all text labels exactly as shown in the image
7. Ensure proper flow direction and connections

IMPORTANT MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:
- Always use '-->' for arrows (never '-- >')
- Node IDs must be followed immediately by node content: A[Process] or B{Decision?}
- Decision nodes use curly braces: {Is condition met?}
- Start/End nodes use double parentheses: ((Start)) or ((End))
- Process nodes use square brackets: [Do something]
- No spaces in arrow syntax: A --> B (not A -- > B)

EXAMPLE:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Process 1]
    B --> C{Decision?}
    C --> D[Process 2]
    C --> E[Process 3]
    D --> F((End))
    E --> F
```

Provide only the Mermaid code without any additional explanation.assistant

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Position feet shoulder width apart, staggered.]
    B --> C[Ensure ability to rock back and forth without falling]
    C --> D[Stable stance ready for serving.]
    D --> E[Volleyball and secondary hand.]
    E --> F[Held the ball in front of the body, above hips and below waist.]
    F --> G{Is the ball too far from the torso?}
    G --> H[Re-adjust ball closer to torso.]
    G --> I{Is the grip on the ball too firm?}
    I --> J[Loosen grip to a gentle hold.]
    I --> K[Ball held correctly in secondary hand.]
    K --> L[Upper body and shoulder position.]
    L --> M[Lean forward slightly, maintaining eye contact with the ball.]
    M --> N[Upper body positioned for serving.]
    N --> O[Dominant hand.]
    O --> P[Close hand, tuck fingers in, rest thumb at the side.]
    P --> Q[End]
    Q --> R[Swing arm back equal distance to intended forward swing.]
    R --> S[Did the arm swing back too far?]
    S --> T[Did the arm swing back too far?]
    T --> U[Arm prepared for swinging motion.]
    U --> V[Body weight distribution]
    V --> W[Shift weight from rear foot to front foot in sync with arm swing.]
    W --> X[Weight correctly distributed for serving.]
    X --> Y[Is the eye on the volleyball]
    Y --> Z[Follow through with swing for power.]
    Z --> A
