## Analyze the flowchart image and convert it to Mermaid syntax.

Follow these requirements strictly:

1. Use proper Mermaid flowchart syntax starting with 'flowchart TD' (top-down) or 'flowchart LR' (left-right)
2. Identify all nodes/boxes and give them appropriate IDs (A, B, C, etc.)
3. Include all decision diamonds with proper syntax using {condition?}
4. Add all connecting arrows and labels using ONLY '-->' (not '-- >' or other variations)
5. Use appropriate node shapes:
   - [Text] for process boxes
   - {Text} for decision diamonds  
   - ((Text)) for start/end circles
   - [Text] for regular rectangles
6. Include all text labels exactly as shown in the image
7. Ensure proper flow direction and connections

IMPORTANT MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:
- Always use '-->' for arrows (never '-- >')
- Node IDs must be followed immediately by node content: A[Process] or B{Decision?}
- Decision nodes use curly braces: {Is condition met?}
- Start/End nodes use double parentheses: ((Start)) or ((End))
- Process nodes use square brackets: [Do something]
- No spaces in arrow syntax: A --> B (not A -- > B)

EXAMPLE:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Process 1]
    B --> C{Decision?}
    C --> D[Process 2]
    C --> E[Process 3]
    D --> F((End))
    E --> F
```

Provide only the Mermaid code without any additional explanation.assistant

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Collect relay specification]
    B --> C[Search for relay data sheets]
    C --> D[Check for pin configuration and ratings]
    D --> E[Inspect relay for visible damage]
    E --> F{Is there visible damage on the relay?}
    F --> G[Relay may be damaged]
    F --> H{Ensure control voltage at coil terminals}
    H --> I{Is control voltage present at the coil terminals?}
    I --> J{Check if relay's LED indicator is on}
    J --> K{Is the relay's LED indicator on?}
    K --> L[Is the electrical work compliant with local laws?]
    L --> M{Relay may be faulty}
    L --> N{Relay likely not receiving power}
    N --> O[Disconnect all power sources]
    O --> P{Be mindful of capacitor}
    P --> Q{Have all power sources been disconnected safely?}
    Q --> R{Check local laws and safety regulations}
    R --> S{End}
    S --> T{Is the electrical work compliant with local laws?}
    T --> U{Does the individual feel safe performing the electrical work?}
    U --> V{Seek professional assistance or ensure compliance}
    V --> W{Leave electrical work to professionals}
    W --> X{End}
    X --> Y{Perform electrical work as per safety guidelines}
    Y --> Z{End}
