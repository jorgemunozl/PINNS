## Analyze the flowchart image and convert it to Mermaid syntax.

Follow these requirements strictly:

1. Use proper Mermaid flowchart syntax starting with 'flowchart TD' (top-down) or 'flowchart LR' (left-right)
2. Identify all nodes/boxes and give them appropriate IDs (A, B, C, etc.)
3. Include all decision diamonds with proper syntax using {condition?}
4. Add all connecting arrows and labels using ONLY '-->' (not '-- >' or other variations)
5. Use appropriate node shapes:
   - [Text] for process boxes
   - {Text} for decision diamonds  
   - ((Text)) for start/end circles
   - [Text] for regular rectangles
6. Include all text labels exactly as shown in the image
7. Ensure proper flow direction and connections

IMPORTANT MERMAID SYNTAX RULES:
- Always use '-->' for arrows (never '-- >')
- Node IDs must be followed immediately by node content: A[Process] or B{Decision?}
- Decision nodes use curly braces: {Is condition met?}
- Start/End nodes use double parentheses: ((Start)) or ((End))
- Process nodes use square brackets: [Do something]
- No spaces in arrow syntax: A --> B (not A -- > B)

EXAMPLE:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Process 1]
    B --> C{Decision?}
    C --> D[Process 2]
    C --> E[Process 3]
    D --> F((End))
    E --> F
```

Provide only the Mermaid code without any additional explanation.assistant

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A((Start)) --> B[Read the Bible and listen to sermons]
    B --> C{Reflect on the information obtained}
    C --> D[Understand what you believe?]
    D --> E[Think and pray about the information]
    E --> F[Decide what being a Christian means to you]
    F --> G[Questions about Christianity you can't answer?]
    G --> H[Visit another church]
    H --> I[Gain insight into varying interpretations]
    I --> J[Reflect on Biblical stories]
    J --> K[Unsure about a particular Bible story?]
    K --> L[Reflect on the story to determine your belief]
    L --> M[Decide whether the story is literal or metaphorical]
    M --> N[Write down your current Christian beliefs]
    N --> O[Analyze and compare beliefs over time]
    O --> P[Keep an ongoing journal of your faith]
    P --> Q[Will you hear other points of view?]
    Q --> R[Listen to both Christian and non-Christian]
    R --> S[Gain new perspectives that may influence your]
    S --> T[Let experiences teach you new things about faith]
    T --> U[End]
    U --> A
